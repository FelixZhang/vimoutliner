VimOutliner is an outline processor with many of the same features as
Grandview, More, Thinktank, Ecco, etc. Features include tree expand/collapse,
tree promotion/demotion, level sensitive colors, interoutline linking, and body
text.

What sets VimOutliner apart from the rest is that it's been constructed from
the ground up for fast and easy authoring.  Keystrokes are quick and easy,
especially for someone knowing the Vim editor. The mouse is completely
unnecessary (but is supported to the extent that Vim supports the mouse). Many
of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma because that's very quick
to type.

Many outliners are prettier than VimOutliner. Most other outliners are more
intuitive for the newbie not knowing Vim. Many outliners are more featureful
than VimOutliner (although VimOutliner gains features monthly and is already
ery powerful).  Some outliners are faster on lookup than
VimOutliner. But as far as we know, NO outliner is faster at getting
information out of your mind and into an outline than VimOutliner.

VimOutliner will always give you lightning fast authoring. That's our basic,
underlying philosophy, and will never change, no matter what features are
added.
